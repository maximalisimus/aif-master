The starting point of the project: Architect Linux installer

This script consists of installing the ArchLinux system in pseudo-graphical mode using the dialog package.
The script can be used with any Archlinux distribution except bootstrap and arm versions. This wizard supports UEFI installation mode when starting the ArchLinux system in UEFI mode.

How to use this wizard?
2 important conditions must be observed:
1) run as root
2) availability of a configured Internet connection in the distribution

This script can be run from anywhere. 
It is enough to make one of the files - used and run it directly in the console.

$ chmod ugo+x aif-installation/aif

$ sudo sh aif-installation/aif

Then just follow the instructions of the master installation.

You can use the setup wizard for the different modes of use of the system ArchLinux.
For example, do not install the graphics component (xorg, display Manager, graphics card driver and others) and use the system completely in console mode.
Or install all the necessary packages to use as a Desktop PC - whether office or home computer.

We wish you good luck.
